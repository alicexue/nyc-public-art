## Inspiration
We've all been influenced by art throughout our lives -- in museums, in homes, and most importantly, in nature. We aimed to make the beauty of art, especially temporary exhibits, more accessible to everyone.

## What it does
PubArt is a website that displays temporary art exhibits in New York City on a map so people can browse and visit pieces that especially speak to them.

## How we built it
We used the Google Maps API, NYC Open Data, Flask, Python, and HTML to organize and display data related to art exhibits.

## Challenges we ran into
Learning the Google Maps API proved more difficult than we expected, but we were able to eventually figure out how to use it successfully.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are especially proud of creating a working email system for users to sign up and receive art-related emails.

## What we learned
We learned how to use APIs and link images, text, and maps to convey a message within a website framework.

## What's next for PubArt
We would love to make PubArt a Pub-licly available website for all New Yorkers to use and enjoy.
